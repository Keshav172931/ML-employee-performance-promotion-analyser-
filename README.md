# 👔 Employee Promotion Analysis

This project analyzes employee data to understand patterns and factors influencing promotions in an organization. It uses data science techniques such as preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling to derive insights.

## 📁 Project Files

- `employee_promotion_data.csv` – Raw employee data containing features such as department, education, previous year rating, and promotion status
- `employee.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with complete analysis: preprocessing, EDA, model training, and evaluation

## 🧠 Key Objectives

- Understand the key factors influencing employee promotion
- Visualize trends and patterns within departments, education levels, and performance ratings
- Build machine learning models to predict employee promotions

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## 🔍 Analysis Summary

- Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables
- Explored correlations between experience, department, rating, and promotion
- Trained models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) to predict promotion status
- Evaluated model performance with accuracy, precision, and recall
